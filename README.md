# UniProtEmbedding
 This python program expects a .tsv file in the data folder containing the embeddings for UniProt proteins as well as a .h5 containing the protein categories.  See the xls file in the data folder for a view of the protein categories.  The .h5 file and .tsv were too large to upload
